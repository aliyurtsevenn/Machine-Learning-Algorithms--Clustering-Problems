# Machine Learning Algorithms

Machnine learning can be applied on classification, regression, or dimensionality reduction tasks of high dimensional datasets. It has multiple algorithms, classification ones can be groupped as supervised and unsupervised. Supervised algorithms are used to create models by using both attributes and labels. Attributes are basically the features which are used to train your model using a certain algorithm. On the ohter hand, the labels are the ones you want to predict. In supervised learning, these labels are used as pre-knowledge to train the algorithm. At the prediction process, which you try to find out which label your sample can be classified with given certain attributes. k-NN, Support vector machnines can be given as an example of supervised classification algorithms. Supervised learning processes are demonstrated below.

1. Generation or collection of data
2. Cleaning the data (Removing missing values, filtering, shuffling)
3. Spliting your part of data (Mostly, 90% of it is used for training the algorithm and 10% is used to test accuracy of your algorithm)
4. Select an algorithm
5. Preprocess your data(Change categorical columns to integer values or scale your values)
6. Train your data
7. Measure the accuracy
8. Find the best parameters for your model 
9. Apply your model onto a new data for prediction

In unsupervised learning, on the other hand, you have no preknowledge of the labels. Attributes are used as to train your model and it is very difficult to make measurements of accuracy. Here, there are many methods of scoring the accuracy and you get the best one as measurement of your accuracy, if you have previously labels of the data. Processes of the unsupervised machine learning is demonstrated below:


1. Generation or collection of data
2. Cleaning the data (Removing missing values, filtering, shuffling)
3. Select an algorithm
4. Preprocess your data(Change categorical columns to integer values or scale your values)
5. Find the best number of clusters if the algorithm requires 
6. Train your data
7. Measure the accuracy if you can 
8. Find the best parameters for your model 
9. Apply your model onto a new data for prediction
